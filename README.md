# learning_python
my first python project, Blackjack (2020)

This is my first project in GitHub

I will try to add new code in order to learn both python and git

# Important!

In order to work, you need to create a folder called "Images" in the same location of the code and move all images there, like I had it on my pc


# Updated ( 21/10/2020 )

The initial code was a simple blackjack game project from the Udemy Course called " 2020 Complete Python Bootcamp : From Zero to Hero in Python " by Jose Portilla

For the final project of the course I decided to take this basic game and expand it with any cool stuff I could think, and learn how to do it in the process.

I added all versions and updates that I have been doing in a couple weeks

v0.1 Added buttons with Ipywidgets and some tweaks

v0.2 Added buttons for everything, sliders and music

v0.3 Added real casino rules and moves,like Doubling bet and Split ( difficult one ) and also explanation for everything in the code

v0.4 Added some pictures, including all card to show and explanation of Rules, also som more tweaking

v0.5 Added a permanent indicator of the chance of busting when hitting and introduced card counting, an strategy used for some experienced players

v1.0 Finally I also added the basic strategy of blackjack, so at every time, the game suggest the best move, but you can decide :)
      Also some final tweakings and intense testing
